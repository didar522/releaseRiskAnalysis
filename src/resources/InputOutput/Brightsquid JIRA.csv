This ability does not require completion of admin approval. 

1. Upon completion of registration, the new user should be automatically logged in and enter their Inbox. (They have just provided their password, so there is no effective difference between logging them in automatically and requiring them to log in) A one-time pop-over should be displayed explaining that the functionality available to them will be limited until their admin approves their account. This should use the following wording: 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to your $Feature Inbox

Congratulations. Your account has been successfully registered. We have sent a message to $AdminFirstName $AdminLastName to approve your request to join $Org. 

Not to worry. You can begin sending and receiving $Feature messages right now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(This content has been added to the Notifications spreadsheet as #162: https://brightsquid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PRODUCT/Updated+notification+messages+and+alerts)

If the user clicks the View Inbox button, the pop-over should be dismissed and the user will find themselves in their Inbox. If the user registered after opening a message notification in their personal email, the corresponding Secure-Mail message should open automatically. 

Most of the features available to a verified user will not be available to this user (please see attached Pending Account Inbox image). They will be able to: 
* View and interact with messages in their Inbox, Sent and Trash
* Compose messages
* Follow Help & Support, Terms & Conditions, and Corporate links
* Click on Dashboard and Patients & Treatment tabs

2. For users with a brand that has access to the the Dashboard and Patients & Treatments tabs, the Secure-Mail inbox should be replaced/covered when accessing those tabs with a message containing the following (see attached Pending Account Dashboard image): 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your account needs to be verified by $AdminFirstName $AdminLastName at $OrgName before you can access this information. 

Please send a reminder of your request to $AdminFirstName $AdminLastName

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(This content has been added to the Notifications spreadsheet as #163: https://brightsquid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PRODUCT/Updated+notification+messages+and+alerts)

If the user clicks the Send Reminder button, a reminder will automatically be sent using the standard content from the notifications spreadsheet. 

As the user would be a Sponsored user, they will be subject to all of the message and attachment limits for that subscription type. 

3. While in the ""pending"" state, these users are effectively ""organization-less"". Because of this, the notifications have been updated to remove reference to the user's Org. Please refer to entry 113b of the Updated Notifications spreadsheet for the changes (https://brightsquid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PRODUCT/Updated+notification+messages+and+alerts)

Note: For those users who have completed registration, but not yet been approved, they should be able to receive messages from users belonging to any organization. For those users sending messages from ""other"" organizations (ie. not the org that the invited user belongs to), this should *not* result in a new invite being sent to the invited user.

Rx Form upload timing out on slow connection.,DENTAL-3588,15551,,Bug,Closed,DENTAL,Dental,software,jaret,"Dental product, built as an extension to platform",,Blocker,Fixed,vlad,francis,francis,19/Jun/15 7:49 PM,23/Jul/15 9:36 PM,01/Jun/17 9:44 AM,20/Jul/15 1:55 PM,Release 2.4.2,,Release 2.5,,,,,,,0,,,"With the introduction on nginx, a slow internet connection (can be simulated through Chrome inspector - see attachment), and large file to upload (i.e. 77M), nginx times out the connection after 60 seconds on the Rx Form upload.  

This situation does not happen on the Secure Mail compose email page with the conditions above.  This situation also does not happen on the Rx Form if nginx was bypassed and jetty was used directly.  The difference is that the upload component used in the compose email page is different then the component used in the Rx Form.

Nginx proxies everything to jetty.  The component used in the Rx Form does not return something back to nginx when a large file is being uploaded on a slow network connection within 60sec.  The component seemed to be waiting on the file to be uploaded before returning an acknowledgement to the proxy.  Of course, nginx timeouts and the connection is closed.

Tried increasing different nginx timeouts and buffering directives.  I had no success.  

The best solution is to replace the upload component in the Rx Form with the same upload component in the compose secure mail page.

","09/Oct/15 1:56 PM;derek;More testing notes... the current plan is to go through two full passes of the patient portal regression test as follows:

Pass #1 will be done with both the old/existing patient portal and the new/merged patient portal app in dental available so that any existing bugs can be verified against the old/existing functionality. Newly discovered but pre-existing bugs will likely not be fixed for the initial release but should be logged and prioritized for future releases. Behaviour between the two versions should be identical, any differences should be logged as bugs. In this configuration all notifications to patients should be received twice, once from each version of the application. During this pass all duplicated old/new notifications should be compared to ensure that they are identical. The only expected differences are in url links in the notifications (different host-names for the old and new application).

Pass #2 will be done with the old/existing patient portal disabled and shut down to ensure that all functionality in the new/merged version works properly and nothing depends on the old application. In this configuration all notifications to patients should only be received once and should match those from pass #1.




","13/Oct/15 10:24 AM;derek;Testing also needs to include checks of patient limits with auto-verification and orgs with different subscription types. My understanding from talking to Jaret is that patient limits do not apply when auto-verification adds a patient to an organization.
","22/Oct/15 1:47 PM;derek;Testing should also include tests of threaded messages to/from patients.

i.e. dental user sends new message to patient, patient reply #1, dental user reply #2, patient reply #3
also patient sends new message to dental user, dental user reply #1, patient reply #2, dental user reply #3

Expectation is that threading does not work very well in existing patient portal and might behave better in the integrated patient app.

Subject: Welcome to $Brand $Feature

Body:

Welcome to the $Brand $Feature, our HIPAA compliant messaging system.

With $Feature you can safely exchange Protected Health Information (PHI) with your patients, dentists, specialists and labs. $Feature  works similar to traditional email with an important distinction - all communication is compliant. Simply compose, attach and send.

Getting Started with $Feature

There are two parts of each $Feature message:

Email Message – $Feature  works with your regular email and will send a notification with a link to every message you receive.  You can edit the “Email Message” in $Feature to personalize your message and provide context to your recipient. The notification is delivered to your recipients’ regular email and should not include any PHI.

$Feature Message – Secure and HIPAA compliant messaging designed to protect your practice and your patients. Information provided in the $Feature  message can contain PHI and include attachments that are up to 500MB (not a typo) in size.

Addressing Messages in $Feature

You may address messages to patients, dentists, specialists and labs by simply entering their address into the “To” field.

On the $Feature page click the blue ‘Compose Message’ button on the upper left

In the ""To"" field enter the email address of the recipient

Compose the “Email Message” or just keep the standard message provided – see above

Compose your “$Feature ” message

Click “Send”

Your colleague will be notified via their email address that a new message has been delivered to their $Feature inbox.

When a user composes a Secure-Mail message to a user that doesn't already have an account, they are able to invite that user. Currently, the inviter is able to specify either a patient or a colleague. By differentiating between a colleague at their own practice and one at another practice, we can auto-populate the practice information (in the first case) and can allow the registered user to be auto-approved if the inviter was a practice admin. 

App behaviour: 

When a new recipient is specified in the ""To:"" field, the invite pop-over will be updated (see attached image)
* The title of the pop-over will be change to ""Invite New <featureName> User""
* The body text will be changed (see attached image)
* Options will be provided for Patient, Colleague at my practice, and Colleague at another practice

If ""Colleague at my practice"" is selected, that information should be auto-populated (and non-editable) for the user when they register. (see attached screenshot)

If the inviting user was the Org Admin, the invited user's account should be automatically verified. 

If the inviting user was not an Org Admin, the invited user should be a ""pending"" user, as per previous functionality. 

Note: When a User A (@ Org A) invites User B (@ Org B), a sponsorship relationship should be effected. User A (and all of their colleagues at Org A) should automatically become sponsors of User B. This relationship should be maintained whether User B is approved or denied by admins at Org B.

Steps to reproduce

Log in as a subscriber
Invite a patient
Receive the patient invite and enter the wrong DOB 3 times
Receive message that says ""You have failed on three attempts to verify the birth date provided by Fauchard Clinic. Please contact the Fauchard Clinic Secure-Mail administrator at or""
Log back in as the original subscriber
Invite the same user with the same email address a second time
Receive the second invite as a patient and follow the link, note that the same error message still appears:  ""You have failed on three attempts to verify the birth date provided by Fauchard Clinic. Please contact the Fauchard Clinic Secure-Mail administrator at or""

Expected result:
When the subscriber sends the second invitation the user should have 3 more tries to register their Patient account.  The earlier failure to register should not impact the 2nd invite

Stray related observations(may need to be separate tickets)
-before a patient has registered they may submit a password reset request.  It doesn't work, but it does tell the user the email address is in our Db
-the error message displayed after 3 failed DOB attepts is truncated weirdly (see screenshot)

There will be some duplication in the classes that remain but ideally not too much and this would eventually allow Secure-Mail to evolve independently and much more quickly without having to ensure that all changes are also compatible with Patients & Treatments.

Most support for Users, Organizations and Roles should move to Secure-Mail and APIs allowing for required functions should be added. These can then be used by Patients & Treatments to send Secure-Mail messages as required.

- remove use of FundableContentService for messages in MessageService

- copy AssetAttachmentService implementation into MessageAttachmentService and significantly simplify the db and class representation of message attachments

- remove use of Events and EventRecipientResolverStrategy from Secure Mail and do something much simpler
- these are large class hierarchies mostly used by Patients & Treatments

- entirely disconnect Patients & Treatments from Secure Mail while still in the same application & database servers

- other work to deal with Users, Organizations and mappings between them will be required 
- dynamically created Roles (ROLE_ORGnnnn_xxxxx) created in OrganizationService are only used by Patients & Treatments
- Secure Mail should not require any spring permissions, Acl, AclEntry, AclObjectIdentity etc. 

- once all ties between the two applications have been removed it should be relatively straightforward to move Secure Mail to its own separate application server and database

Ultimately these objects will have a many-to-many relationship, with each user potentially having access to several accounts and each account potentially having several users with access.

Ideally this solution will clean up the handling of messages to/from patients where patients only ever see the organization name they receive messages from or send messages to. i.e. if these organizations each had a shared organization account this would be the account sending messages to patients and receiving messages from patients.

The first stage of this prototype will involve the addition of an Account concept and attempting to rework the secure mail services (primarily the MessageService but likely others) to use Account in places where they current use User and PatientContact.
",,derek,,,,,,"Concept of Account has been added between Folder and User (i.e. Folder -> Account -> User) without much trouble. 

However changing Messages to use Account as sender and recipients is much more involved. Many places in the existing code base expect Users in these fields and enforce various rules based on User attributes. Working through all of these will be involved and time consuming.

Based on some customer complaints recently and some research by Daniel and Phil we have determined that there appear to be some deficiencies in the email notifications related to events in Patients & Treatments.  In testing and validating these bugs I stumbled upon a couple of other irregularities.

As is often the case with P&T events, the conditions required to test a specific event are specific and labyrinthine.  To that end, I will first describe my testing platform, assumptions and actors (accounts) in this merry chase.

Testing Environment: https://dev.brightsquid.com:8844/dental/

****

Step 1: As Rontgen I invited two users to sponsored accounts mark@brightsquid.com and mark.eyre@gmail.com.  mark@ became the user Doctor Doctor at the practice ABC Dental, since he was first in the door Doctor Doctor is also the admin for ABC Dental.  Once Doctor Doctor was established mark.eyre@gmail.com created the user account Office Manager, this user was approved by Doctor Doctor to be welcomed into the ABC Dental organization.

Step 2:  As the system SuperAdmin I logged into the admin tool and upgraded Office Manager to a Sponsored account (from Free Trial) and set his sponsor to Rontgen.

 

Testing Begins

Step 3: As Rontgen I attempted to create a patient record on behalf of Doctor Doctor.  On the patient creation screen I was unable to set the referring practice to Doctor Doctor.  Instead I had to create the patient with the default referring dentist (Rontgen) and change it after the fact.  I waited a long time for the search to complete.

BUG#1 – When creating a patient profile a subscriber cannot assign a patient to their sponsored colleague’s account. (screenshot attached)

 

Step 4: As Rontgen, create a treatment plan for the patient that belongs to ABC Family Dental, then updated the treatment plan and monitored notifications to the users Doctor Doctor and Office Manager.  In this first test the treatment plan had only one stage and that stage remained the responsibility of Rontgen.

For the following events (by Rontgen) Doctor Doctor was notified

Patient created

Treatment Launched

New Stage added to treatment

 

For the following events (by Rontgen) Doctor Doctor was NOT notified

File added to an existing treatment

Image annotated

Comment added to an existing treatment stage

Stage Shared to Rontgen’s other colleagues

Treatment Stage date changed

 

The user “Office Manager” was not notified of any of the above events.

 

BUG#2 – The sponsored account holder who is the administrator an organization is not notified of all events related to a patient that is linked to their practice.

***In my opinion if patient John Doe belongs to ABC Dental then any event that affects John Doe should generate a notification to all members of ABC Dental.

BUG#3 – The sponsored account holder who is not the administrator of an organization is not notified of ANY events related to a patient that is linked to their practice.

 

Step 5: As Rontgen I created a new patient, linked it to ABC Family dental and created a single stage treatment plan for that patient, then updated the treatment plan and monitored notifications to the users Doctor Doctor and Office Manager.    In this test the single stage treatment plan was assigned to (or referred to) Doctor Doctor.

 

For the following events (by Rontgen) Doctor Doctor was notified

Patient Created

Treatment Launched

Image/File Added

Image annotated

New Stage added to treatment plan

Stage Shared to Rontgen’s other colleagues

Treatment Stage date changed

 

For the following events (by Rontgen) Doctor Doctor was not notified

Comment added to an existing treatment stage - This looks like an issue (Jaret)

 

For the following events the user Office Manager was notified

Treatment Stage date changed

 

For the following events the user Office Manager was not notified

Patient Created

Treatment Launched

Image/File Added

Image annotated

New Stage added to treatment plan

Stage Shared to Rontgen’s other colleagues

Comment added to an existing treatment stage

 

BUG#4 - The sponsored account holder who is the administrator an organization is not notified of all events related to a patient that is linked to their practice, even if a treatment stage is assigned directly to that sponsored user.

BUG#5 - The sponsored account holder who is not the administrator of an organization is not notified of most events related to a patient that is linked to their practice even if that treatment is assigned directly to a member of that sponsored user’s practice.",,francis,jaret,mark,vlad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DENTAL-3703,,15/Sep/15 11:01 AM;mark;referringpractice.JPG;https://brightsquid.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/13290/referringpractice.JPG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,0|i00793:,,,,,,,,2015-07-06 20:53:27.0,"29/Jun/15 11:24 PM;francis;In followup to Mark's test scenarios, I looked at the logs generated on demo instance2 and saw no exceptions and anomalies after Doctor Doctor and Office Manager accounts were created.","06/Jul/15 8:53 PM;vlad;will address bug #1 as a separate issue DENTAL-3627

","15/Sep/15 11:01 AM;mark;Unfortunately the assumption that the Doctor is the patient owner is incorrect.  From the point of view of the end user the patient owner is the practice as indicated on the patient profile page wherein the patient is ""assigned"" to a referring practice and not a referring doctor or person (see attached screenshot).  

Therefore notifications to the patient owner should go to all members of the practice and not just the defined individual owner.  ",,,,,,,

Fauchard creates a treatment and then shares it with Ed Angle.

Fauchard gets an email notification (see attached) that He has shared the case.  This is redundant, we do not need to notify people of things they do (did).

* When providing their city/town, no attempt should be made to provide suggested state/province match based on input from previous users (saving these combinations for future use is also not required). The input should be recorded as entered. 
* Autocompletion of the city/town should be deprecated (ie. does not need to be removed, but no efforts should be made to facilitate this functionality for future releases)
* When the user selects a country, a state/province list may be revealed. That field should not be mandatory (as per current behaviour) and by default the state/province should be blank (ex. not Alabama). 

=======================

Original bug report from Mark:

There have been multiple complaints from newly created sponsored users whos addresses in BSQ indicate that their Organization's state is Alabama when they are actually from a different state.

It would be easy to dismiss this as user error, but there are simply far too many of these errors in the system to write it off.

If I look at the 50 most recently created organizations I can see that 4 of them are listed as being in Alabama, however none of the cities listed are in Alabama.  That is; Decatur, Alabama (should be Georgia), Franklin Alabama, (should be Nebraska), Lincoln, Alabama (should be Nebraska) and Homewood, Alabama (should be Illinois)

My suspicion is that users often leave that field blank when registering because it is not mandatory and does not even appear until the user selects their country.  If the field is blank then perhaps the system in some cases applies the first option (Alabama) in place of a blank value  -- I'm guessing of course.  

This requires some investigation that the customer support team does not have the resources to carry out; primarily because the demo instance we have access to only offers 2 states in the address drop down.

The recent Alabama selection can be explained that users select the first entry from City selection (auto-complete) and dontè change (or don;t notice) the state after that. I think it concerns many city selection.

To replicate:

As fauchard, send a Secure-mail message to a patient (I used mark@brightsquid.com as the email address)
Do not register as that patient
Navigate to the patient log in screen and select ""Forgot your Password?""
Submit mark@brightsquid.com as your email address and see the message: ""An email was sent to mark@brightsquid.com containing a link with which you will be able to reset your password. ""

In fact no message is sent, nor should it be.

The expected result is that the user should see a message such as the one in the attached screenshot

As an evolution to migrating towards a distributed model for the storage of PHI data, we need to simplify the Patient and Dental app.  Part of that effort means consolidating the two db schemas together as well as removing the restful services between the two apps.

Effectively, the patient schema just becomes part of the dental schema.  The patient app should just point to the dental db schema.

If a user clicks on a link in an email notification but are currently logged into a different secure-mail account they encounter an ugly black error that reads ""You do not have access to the requested resource""

Use case example
Clara monitors her own email inbox and that of Dr Fauchard and they both have SEcure-Mail accounts.  When an email notification comes in for DrF, Clara gets it and clicks on the link.  Since she is already logged into (or cookied) her SEcure-Mail account she is not permitted to view the Secure-Mail message and she gets the error.

Customers can't figure this out because the error message is black, scary and vauge.

The error message should say something more meaningful to the user such as:

You are currently logged in as Clara Barton <cbarton@fauchardclinic.com> however this message is not addressed to you.

The last step of patient registration (PatientRegistrationController) calls registerNewPatientForOrg which calls setNewUserPassword and then reAuthenticateUserInSession which clears the current authentication.

The spring security rule <intercept-url pattern=""/patient/**"" access=""permitAll""/> requires an anonymously authenticated user (not an unauthenticated user) and after calling reAuthenticateUserInSession the current anonymous user is not authenticated. This causes the final page confirm.jsp in the patient registration flow to be redirected to /login when it requests a resource such as startup.js which spring then caches (as if it were a bookmarked request) and once the user has logged in spring redirects them to this cached url.

To fix this we need to either change the spring intercept above to filters=""none"" which appears to have some downside, or to create a new anonymous authentication before redirecting to the final page of the registration process.

Two potential solutions to this problem

1 - rewrite the old url to take the patient to their inbox and let them find the message themselves
2 - create a new table in dental that contains the patient message id, patient id and message view id and rewrite the old url with a new parameter pmid=... and then use this to forward them to the specific message details

Hi Jaret, I have copied Chris on this message as I know this same issue has been reported via the Caleo Project and is relevant to his interests.

As stated below, the complaint from the customer is that patients can mass-email the entire practice instead of addressing the message to a specific user.

IMHO I see two methods to address this matter:
1-Allow patients to address their message to a specific user
2-Allow practice members to turn off notifications of incoming patient messages

Please log this as a future enhancement (if you haven't already).

Thx
Mark

Hello Mark,

Here is the email to explain the issue we are having with a feature of Brightsquid. We had a patient email us regarding her appointment. Instead of just emailing me back directly simply wanting a confirmation of her appointment, she ended up emailing back the entire office including the doctors. So, 20 people got the same email requesting information and she received multiple replies. Our office already has policies and protocols in place to ensure a patient is seen if there is an emergency or urgent matter and we do not need this feature. We would appreciate a way to stop patients from being able to mass message the entire office as this creates a chaotic and confusing situation for all.

Please keep me updated on this matter.

Found during testing of changes for DENTAL-3614. With bidirectional mapping in place the User_PatientCase table contains 78 mappings after a bootstrap and integration test run. With only the PatientCase -> User mapping in place this table contains 87 mappings. While running with the bidirectional mapping and hibernate logging enabled various deletes of User_PatientCase are issued and it appears that this is the cause of the missing 11 rows at the end of a test run. These deletes do not appear to be issued for any reason, the bootstrap code is not deleting cases from users and it appears that duplicate set membership is confusing Hibernate into doing incorrect operations.

In both cases below the execution of the task takes over 5 minutes to complete in the production enviroment.

Task 1
Updating a sponsored or free user to paid

Task 2
Setting a user account to support and indicating who they are supporting
Method: view a user in the admin panel and change their subscription type to ""Support"" (wait a few minutes), in the row ""Support for user:_________"" click on Manage and select a licensed user the save the change (this will take over 5 minutes to execute)

- the primary goal is to ensure that existing data is not damaged by patient migration script
- the secondary goal is to ensure that patient data is properly migrated to the dental db and is useable by the merged patient ui

Testing Procedure

- procedure is to send messages from dental users to test patients (with attachments, replies, etc.) and from test patients back to dental users
- run migration script after test data is created
- after migration has run verify that all previously created messages are intact and unchanged in both the dental and existing/separate patient app (primary goal)
- also verify that all previously created messages are intact and available in the new unified patient app (secondary goal)

- note that the unified patient application will be configured to be available in the migration instance at https://devpatient.brightsquid.com/dental/

1. this issue (Major) was raised for grid showing only 15 records irrespective of count.
2. Brightsquid users will be slow irrespective, they have 20,000 connections. Normally users would not see more than 200 orgs.
3. If we want to show only 15 initially, pagination should be implemented, please create a improvement for 2.9, it can't go for 2.8.1.

Previous note from Mark.
------ 

Hey Guys,

Daniel just pointed this out to me with an installation he was doing.

We need to be very careful when creating new users in the darknet.  By default the ""Brightsquid"" brand is selected for all new user accounts and the instant you click the ""Create User"" button the brand is assigned to that user and the welcome email is placed in their Secure-Mail inbox.  Once that happens there is no taking it back, which means if I am creating a 3M user and forget to set the brand before I save the user account they will see the wrong email message.

The short version; be sure to set the appropriate brand for a new user's account before you create the user account.

Question for Francis/Jaret:  Can the user creation page be adjusted to have blank brand and cannot be saved unless a brand is explicitly chosen?  This would prevent us accidentally setting the ""default"" branding.",,akash.gupta,francis,jaret,prabhu.veluswamy,,,,,,,28800,28800,,0%,28800,28800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{repository={count=3, dataType=repository}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""repository"":{""overall"":{""count"":3,""lastUpdated"":""2015-10-21T02:36:07.000-0600""},""byInstanceType"":{""github"":{""count"":3,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,,,,,,,,0|i004cn:,,Dental Sprint #21,,,,,,2015-10-21 07:36:40.843,21/Oct/15 7:36 AM;akash.gupta;https://github.com/brightsquid/platform/commit/11be3ac185829a8cff2e169cdc5f8d0a30138108,"27/Oct/15 5:45 AM;prabhu.veluswamy;Working fine.

Refer attached screen captures.

Note: Basically free users will not be listed in ""Share Stage"" window list. But it is possible when share through group.

--------------------------------
Steps to reproduce:
--------------------------------
1) Login as pfauchard.
2) Create patient & treatments.
3) Share treatment with groups which contains Free users.
4) Login as free user's mail account.
5) Check the notification mail received for shared treatment stages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected:
Free users should not be able to be added to a group. (see details below in Proposed Solution)

Actual:
BDL is user allowed to share treatments with free users. 

Proposed Solution: 
- For Free users, the ""Add to Group"" option should be removed from their entry in the My Colleagues section of the Network tab
- When using any of the multi-select green ""+ Add to Group"" buttons in the Network tab, the users will be reviewed to see whether any are Free users. If so, the following message will displayed to the inviting user in a pop-over: 

""The following user(s) have subscriptions that do not allow for them to be added to groups:"" 

...which will be followed by a list of those users in the format: ""<name> (org name)""

In addition, testing against the baseline anonymized data might not be sufficient as it might not be a true representation of the production data set.  The anonymizing scripts something populate nullable columns / remove certain data columns when filtering.

Of certain concerns are:
- what happens when to the running state of a quartz job after the outage and after the quartz schema have changed
- what happens to functionality after the application after the schemaupdates have been introduced.

- When using any of the multi-select green ""+ Add to Group"" buttons in the Network tab, the users will be reviewed to see whether any are branded users. If so, the following message will displayed to the inviting user in a pop-over:

In release 2.3 we set the company name to 3Mu2120.  It was never tested because we were not using baseline for testing.  We were using bootstrap and bootstrap created the right service mark through bootstrap data creation process.  The company name 3Mu2120 could be seen in the current 2.7 baseline on instance7.  In the candidate 2.7 release on instance1 with bootstrap the company name is 3M℠.

Script added 2.7 schemaUpdate to change the companyName to 3M℠ which will fix part of this issue.

2) The other issue is that since the companyName was incorrect, users that were branded 3M had their default email signature created incorrectly.  Mark will be updated the email signatures for these 3M users manually through the admin tool

3) Secure email body and email notification that contained the incorrect companyName already in production will not be fix.

In addition with the upcoming two onsite audits, upgrading the MySQL db becomes more imminent due to security concerns.

It is imperative the db should be upgraded to the latest version of 5.5. - MySQL 5.5.42.

Note: We cannot yet upgrade to MySQL 5.6.4+ due to the Datetime differences which will affect the user password hash and some integration tests.

"When a user sends a zip file, the recipient gets notifications for each of the files in the zip",DENTAL-3412,15310,,Bug,Closed,DENTAL,Dental,software,jaret,"Dental product, built as an extension to platform",,Major,Fixed,eduard,jaret,jaret,23/Apr/15 10:45 PM,15/Sep/15 1:48 PM,01/Jun/17 9:44 AM,15/Sep/15 12:55 PM,,,Release 2.5,,,Secure-Mail,,,,0,,,"Observed behaviour:

When a user attaches a zip file, the recipient receives notification messages and update to their Dashboard. Sometimes they receive a single notification email with details for each of the files and other times they receive a notification email for each file contained in the zip file. 

(We speculate that this behaviour occurs is that our Secure-mail system is reusing some notifications intended to work with cases and treatments which results in these types of errors.)

Desired behaviour: 

The recipient should receive only one notification message for a new Secure-Mail (whether it contains a zip file or not) and should not receive any updates to their Dashboard. 

*** Original description from Mark ***

When a user attaches a .zip folder, the Secure-Mail system unpacks the zip folder after delivery and in some cases delivers a redundant and poorly formatted email notification to the recipient for each file in the original zip folder.  Also, during the unzip process the system places a notification in the recipients Dashboard for each unpacked file.

What happened yesterday (and the day before) is that Mark Ferguson at Core3D Las Vegas sent 4 secure-mail messages with at least one zip file attached the messages were addressed to multiple recipients in Mark's Org.   I think that Secure-mail then sent one notification to each recipient for every file in the zip [(1 zip folder with 100 files) * 5 recipients = 500 email notifications]

In some cases, a user can have pending invites even after an account has been successfully registered for them. Those invites (which probably shouldn't exist in the first place) need to be able to be cancelled. 

***Original email from Daniel***

Hi Guys,

The attached video is for secondary issue I encountered with a customer yesterday. Clarke Street Dental, Org ID2956, requested we call one of their sponsored users who was having difficulty with the registration process.

Before I followed up with the sponsored user I asked Wendy, the contact at Clarke Street Dental, to provide contact information about the user. She provided the email address and a search in Mandrill did not yield a result for any type of invitation. She then indicated that the contact was still listed in the 'Invitations Outstanding' section and I assumed it was a situation where the invitation was not delivered to the contact and asked Wendy to send a reminder which was picked up by Mandrill.

I contacted the other dental practice, Schrott Perio Implants Org ID3292,and discovered that the problem was not a notification delivery issue, but a 'Pending Admin Approval' issue. I located the existing account it was listed as Free. I Had the contact try to approve the account but the notification icon next to the Dashboard link had no activity. They then decided not to move forward with the activation of the new account as the existing one was sufficient.

I followed up with Wendy, and asked her to cancel the invitation, but she is not able to. She also indicated that there were other outstanding invitations that she cannot cancel, as well. You would observe, in the video, an invitation to the email addressSilarts@yahoo.com. This email address belongs to Clarke Street Dental and it is listed as a 'Support User' with User ID16547. So at the moment there invitation that cannot be removed given the existence of accounts or pending admin approvals that cannot be authorised.

This situation may also exist with other users and may need some further looking into.

In some cases these methods have entirely separate implementations, with entirely different query criteria, even though they are intended to return the same data, only in different formats.

In particular, the two implementations of getMessageSenders use separate criteria and when changed to use the criteria currently used by the web version  we noticed that the api version of this query was returning message views with the incorrect recipient names and ids. The current API implementation of this method uses the ""folders"" property on the User domain object which prevents its removal in DENTAL-3473. Using the associated web criteria will allow this field to be removed.

This is due to a restriction that is effectively (messageSender != currentUser OR messageRecipient == currentUser). The first half of this restriction is almost useless as almost all messages in the database will not have been sent by the current user. In addition, because of the logical OR all of these unrelated messages are included by the query.

The intent is to fix this criteria to only use (messageRecipient == currentUser) to avoid including unwanted messages in various queries. In addition, the duplicate implementations of similar or identical GWT and API methods will be cleaned up where possible.

When viewing a message from their practice a patient can mouse-over the practice info, this opens a pop-up card that has an envelope icon.  Presumably if they patient clicks on the envelope icon the system should compose a new message to that practice.

Instead, the message is addressed to the wrong practice (every time)  See attached screenshots for clarification.

Lack of input validation when entering patient birthdate results in wrong date being stored,DENTAL-3590,15553,,Bug,Closed,DENTAL,Dental,software,jaret,"Dental product, built as an extension to platform",,Major,Fixed,polina,jaret,jaret,22/Jun/15 5:31 PM,02/Sep/15 11:48 AM,01/Jun/17 9:44 AM,07/Aug/15 8:11 PM,Release 2.4.2,,3M 1.0 (Field Eval),Release 2.6,,,,,,0,,,"Lack of input validation allows for users to enter birthdates that are stored incorrectly for patient date of birth (DoB). This issue is compounded by users in other countries where the standard for dates is different (ex. MM/DD/YYYY vs. YYYY/MM/DD vs. DD/MM/YYYY). 

For example, a user inviting a patient can provide ""14/04/1979"" for the DoB (see attached image). When checking the DoB in Invitations Outstanding, the inviter will see ""02/04/1980"". The date ""14/04/1979"" is interpreted as the 4th day of the 14th month of 1979 OR February 4, 1980. (see attached images)

Requirement: 

When the inviter attempts to send the invite, the format of the date should be checked for valid input (ex. there are only 12 months in a year, there are only 30 days in November, all years require 4 numbers, etc.). If the format is not valid, the following pop-over should display, with an ""Okay"" button to dismiss. 

""The date of birth you've provided has an invalid format. Please provide the date of birth in MM/DD/YYYY format.""

We parse our dates using the MM/DD/YYYY pattern, hence 14/04/1979 becomes 02/04/1980 (see below for an explanation why: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16172872/gwt-datetimeformat-returns-the-wrong-date).

Suggestions of how to address this: change parsing format to MMM/DD/YYYY to avoid confusion between DD and MM or disable typing/pasting into the date textbox and enforce entering date using the calendar popup only.","25/Jun/15 5:22 PM;francis;The Java Date library is notorious for mod-ing and incrementing the date value.  For example,  a month value of 14 is actually February the year after.

To get around validating the date, you have to do the following extra check in addition to the other checks that are being done:
- d1 = user entered date
- s1 = d1 as string format of YYYYMMDD
- d2 = covert s1 to date 
- if d1 == d2, then date is valid, else user entered date is invalid.",05/Aug/15 5:20 PM;mark;Please be sure to include a rule that disallows any birthdate older than 01/01/1915.,"12/Aug/15 11:18 AM;prabhu.veluswamy;Tested in dev: https://dev3m.brightsquid.com/dental/

When a patient fails to accept their invite, because of a bad birth date, after 3 attempts the invite is marked as DELETED. The clinic can then send a new invite to the same email address with a different birth date.

Alternatively, the clinic can cancel a bad invite with an incorrect birth date (which marks it as DELETED) and then send a new one with a different birth date. 

If multiple clinics invite the same patient email address with different birth dates, the last birth date received is stored with the patient contact and all other invites must use this birth date for correct verification.

After the patient is verified subsequent invites will not update their birth date, first name or last name. Accepting these invites will allow the patient to update their first name or last name and must use the original verified birth date. (i.e. the patient has no ability to change their birth date after accepting their first invite).

Scenarios for testing: 

Scenario 1: 
 - Clinic A sends an invite to a patient
 - The patient registers successfully, providing the same date-of-birth (DoB)

Scenario 2: 
 - Clinic A sends an invite to a patient
 - The patient attempts to register (3 times), providing a different DoB, and fails to register
 - Clinic A re-sends the invitation, providing a matching DoB to the one provided by the patient
 - The patient successfully registers using the same DoB they provided the first time

Scenario 3: 
 - Clinic A sends an invite to a patient
 - The patient registers, providing the same date-of-birth
 - Clinic B sends an invite to a patient, providing a different DoB
 - The patient registers, using the DoB they provided the first time, and successfully accept the invite from Clinic B

Scenario 4: 
 - Clinic A sends an invite to a patient
 - Clinic B sends an invite to a patient, providing a different DoB
 - The patient registers, providing the same date-of-birth as provided by Clinic B
 - The patient's registration succeeds 

Scenario 5:
 - Clinic A sends an invite to a patient
 - Clinic B sends an invite to a patient, providing a different DoB
 - The patient registers, providing the same date-of-birth as provided by Clinic A
 - The patient attempts to register (3 times), providing a different DoB, and fails to register

For the time being, we should inform Caleo to type in the message rather than cut/paste from a section.  This should immediately stop the problem from occurring.  

For the long term solution, the invite form should be tag insensitive and ignore all tags during the save.

Block Cross-Frame Scripting,DENTAL-3272,15129,,Improvement,Closed,DENTAL,Dental,software,jaret,"Dental product, built as an extension to platform",,Major,Fixed,francis,francis,francis,25/Mar/15 5:50 PM,02/Sep/15 11:25 AM,01/Jun/17 9:44 AM,24/Apr/15 6:09 PM,Release 2.3,,Release 2.4,,,,,,,0,,,"Page:  https://dev.brightsquid.com:8844/dental/

The 3M application security scan has found a Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) vulnerability that can allow an attacker to load the vulnerable application inside an HTML iframe tag on a malicious page. The attacker could use this weakness to devise a Clickjacking attack to conduct phishing, frame sniffing, social engineering or Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

How to remediate the issue.

Browser vendors have introduced and adopted a policy-based mitigation technique using the X-Frame-Options header. Developers can use this header to instruct the browser about appropriate actions to perform if their site is included inside an iframe. Developers must set the X-Frame-Options header to one of the following permitted values:

 DENY    Deny all attempts to frame the page

 SAMEORIGIN    The page can be framed by another page only if it belongs to the same origin as the page being framed

 ALLOW-FROM <origin>      Developers can specify a list of trusted origins in the origin attribute. Only pages on origin are permitted to load this page inside an iframe

Developers should also use client-side frame busting JavaScript as a protection against XFS. This will enable users of older browsers that do not support the X-Frame-Options header to also be protected from clickjacking attack

When a Sponsored user clicks on the Invite a Colleague button, a pop-over will open with a message indicating that during the beta period, a Sponsored user will not be able to invite Free users. An ""Okay"" button will allow the user to dismiss the pop-over. The exact content of the message will be as follows: 

Pop-over title: ""<companyName> <productName> Sponsored User""

Pop-over body content: 

""As a sponsored user you are currently unable invite new colleagues to participate in <companyName> <productName>. We have done this to maintain integrity during this introductory period. This limitation is temporary, and we look forward to helping you connect with all your colleagues in the very near future. 

Please contact <supportPhone> or <supportEmail> if you have any questions or would like more information. ""

*Inviting a user via Secure-Mail message*

When a recipient is to be added to the Selected Recipients list (ex. when pressing tab to add that address) by a Sponsored User for a partner brand, a check should be performed whether the recipient is the user's sponsor. 

1. If the recipient is the user's sponsor, the sponsor should be added to the Recipient List

2. If they are not the user's sponsor, the Recipient List should be checked for the user's sponsor. 

     (a) If the sponsor is not in the Recipient List, a pop-over should open displaying a message indicating that the user's sponsor must be included in the Recipient List during the Field Evaluation/Beta period. An ""Okay"" button should allow the user to dismiss the pop-over. The recipient should not be added to the Recipient List. 

Pop-over title: ""<companyName> <productName> Sponsored User""

Pop-over body content: 

""You currently have a Sponsored account. To send this message to a patient, you must include your Sponsor in the “To” field. 

Please contact <supportPhone> or <supportEmail> if you have any questions or would like more information.""

     (b) If the sponsor is in the Recipient List, a pop-over should open asking the user to confirm that the recipient is a patient. They should be able to select ""Patient"" or ""Colleague"". 

Pop-over title: ""Please Confirm the Following Email Address""

Pop-over body content: 

""Before sending this <featureName> message, please take a moment to indicate whether this recipient is a colleague or a patient.""

          i. If they select ""Patient"", a date-of-birth field should then be displayed as in the dialogue from the standard ""Invite via Secure-Mail message"" workflow (see attached image). Once the date of birth has been provided, the user should be able to click an ""Okay"" button to add the recipient. 
          ii. If they select ""Colleague"", a pop-over should open displaying a message indicating that Sponsored users are not able to invite new colleagues during the Field Evaluation/Beta period. An ""OK"" button should allow the user to dismiss the pop-over. The recipient should not be added to the Recipient List. 

Pop-over title: ""<companyName> <productName> Sponsored User""

Pop-over body content: 

""As a sponsored user you are currently unable invite new colleagues to participate in <companyName> <productName>. We have done this to maintain integrity during this introductory period.

From Daniel's original email: 

Hi Jaret,

As we discussed this morning, currently the creation of a Support User is like the wild west in regards to the user name. 
There is no type of restriction in the creation of the username and it is left up to the account admin imagination.

Below is an example of a username created by an admin:
Michael N. Poulos

If you like you can access the admin console and take a look at the account for yourself. The user ID is 25535.
When the user tried logging into the account they got the username or password not valid error. Additionally, these accounts that are not created correctly are disabled and unused in the system creating dirty data.

I believe the username should have restrictions in regards to format and such badly created accounts should be deleted from the system.",,jaret,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,0|i007sv:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an expected behaviour in the way the new auto complete and advance search is implemented when composing an email.  However, it is very confusing and not what is expected from an end user.

1) Log in as caleo (spinetriage@caleohealth.c)
2) Compose and search on ""Cund"" for ""Cundal"" only finds ""Julie Torrans @ C S Cundal Prof Corp"" and not ""Cory Cundal""
3) Searching on ""Cory"" will find ""Cory Cundal""

spinetriage@caleohealth is a Premium subscription.  Cory Cundal is not in spinetriage's network.

The reason the search for ""Cund"" finds Julie is because the organization is in the network and the search ends there excluding Cory Cundal who is outside Caleo's network.

The reason the search for ""Cory"" finds Cory Cundal is because ""Cory"" is not in Caleo's network so the search is executed for ""Cory"" outside the network.

The search behaviour needs to be readdressed from a user's perspective.",,francis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,0|i007xb:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reissue or renew session ID once a user logs in,DENTAL-3271,15128,,Improvement,Closed,DENTAL,Dental,software,jaret,"Dental product, built as an extension to platform",,Major,Fixed,eduard,francis,francis,25/Mar/15 5:45 PM,02/Jun/15 6:25 PM,01/Jun/17 9:44 AM,02/Jun/15 5:34 PM,Release 2.3,,Release 2.3.1,,,,,,,0,,,"Page:  https://dev.brightsquid.com:8844/dental/doLogin

The 3M webapp security scan has found a session fixation vulnerability on the site.  Session fixation allows an attacker to impersonate a user by abusing an authenticated session ID (SID). This attack can occur when a web application:
- Fails to supply a new, unique SID to a user following a successful authentication
- Allows a user to provide the SID to be used after authenticating


How to remediate the issue.

The best way to prevent session fixation attacks is to renew the session ID when a user logs in. This fix can be done at the code level or framework level, depending on where the session management functionality is implemented. Example 1: the following PHP code changes the session ID after users log in successfully:
    If ($authenication_successful) {
        $_session[“authenticated”] = true;
        Session_regenerate_id();
    }

Example 2: When deploying web applications to Apache Tomcat, care must be taken to set the “changeSessionIdOnAuthentication” attribute in context.xml to true.

Additionally, session IDs should be sufficiently random and should be invalidated at logout.

For example, a busy Dentist might want the desk staff to be able to read (and potentially reply to) incoming Secure-Mail messages from colleagues. 

From Mark's original feature request: 

-Many practices are configured such that there is a ""receptionist"" inbox that many staff members have access to and are responsible for monitoring.  When we extend this concept into Secure-Mail users wind up not able to continue their typical workflow. 

-There are cases where a Doctor wants to use Secure-Mail most of the time, but also would like his staff to be able to monitor their account.

-If a Secure-Mail user is unavailable their private messages are no longer received and acted upon.

All of these issues could be addressed via the following enhancement:

Multi User (cohort access) inboxes

If we allowed a practice administrator to turn on this feature then specified users in an organizations could be permitted to access and utilize each other's accounts.

For example, when you are on vacation I could log into your account and if I needed to respond to a message that was sent to you I could send a message that would be ""sent by Mark Eyre on behalf of Jaret Hargreaves.""

In a more permanent configuration, Dan, Phil and I could all monitor support@brightsquid.com by viewing that shared inbox in a tab of our own private inboxes.  (see crappy mock up attached)

This would likely be a pretty major piece of work; but I feel it would help immensely with the receptionist issue.

When I screen shared with her is was the confusion was in how the icon labelled the text file as a word document though above the icon it says TXT. The attached image displays what I'm talking about.
